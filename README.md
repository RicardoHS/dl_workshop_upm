# Deep learning introductory workshop
Notebooks for the introductory workshop on deep learning held at ETSISI, Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, in October '17.

## Content
* linear_regression: Contains all the linear regression examples we saw during the first session (house prices)
* logistic_regression: Contains all the logistic regression examples we saw during the first session (binary classification)
* ann_xor: Introduces the "Learning XOR" problem. The XOR is a very simple function that linear models such as logistic regression cannot learn. This serves as a motivation for introducing neural networks, and more generally, deep non-linear models.
* ann_mnist: This notebook introduces some aspects of the Keras API, demonstrated on the MNIST handwritten digit data set (a classic benchmark in computer vision).
* cnn_mnist: This notebook introduces convolutional neural networks, widely employed for computer vision, using Keras. Their performance is demonstrated on the MNIST handwritten digit data set.
* transfer_learning: This notebook introduces the concept of transfer learning in computer vision. We use the weights of the VGG-16 network, trained on the ImageNet data set, to quickly build a strikingly accurate image classifier using a moderately sized data set.
 * scripts/pad_ct101.py: This script converts all the images in the specified (hardcoded) directory to a convenient format for the VGG network.
